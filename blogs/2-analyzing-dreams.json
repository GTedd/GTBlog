      "The Akasha Terminal once harvested dreams, but now we understand their true value. Dreams are the mind's way of organizing chaos into order.",
      "When we sleep, our subconscious paints with colors we've never seen and speaks in riddles we must decipher. It is a personal domain where the laws of physics do not apply, only the laws of emotion.",
      "Do not fear the nightmare, for it is merely a question your heart is asking. Do not cling to the sweet dream, for it is a fleeting comfort. Observe them all, and you will know yourself."

      "虚空终端曾经收割梦境，但现在我们明白了它们真正的价值。梦是心灵将混乱整理为秩序的方式。",
      "当我们沉睡时，潜意识用我们从未见过的颜色作画，用我们需要解读的谜语说话。这是一个私人领域，物理定律不适用，适用的只有情感定律。",
      "不要害怕噩梦，因为它只是你内心提出的一个问题。不要执着于美梦，因为那是转瞬即逝的慰藉。观察它们，你将认识你自己。"
