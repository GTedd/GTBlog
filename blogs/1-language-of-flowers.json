      "Have you ever listened closely to the rustling leaves? In Sumeru, we believe that every plant has a memory, a story to tell. The wind carries these stories across the mountains, whispering secrets to those who know how to listen.",
      "Scientific research shows that plants communicate through chemical signals, but I prefer the romantic interpretation: they are singing a slow, ancient song about the sun, the rain, and the earth.",
      "Next time you see a flower blooming, pause for a moment. It might be greeting you."

      "你是否曾仔细倾听过树叶的沙沙声？在须弥，我们相信每一株植物都有记忆，都有故事要诉说。风将这些故事带过群山，向懂得倾听的人低语着秘密。",
      "科学研究表明，植物通过化学信号进行交流，但我更喜欢浪漫的解读：它们正在唱着一首关于太阳、雨水和大地古老而缓慢的歌。",
      "下次当你看到花朵盛开时，请停下来片刻。它可能正在向你问好。"
